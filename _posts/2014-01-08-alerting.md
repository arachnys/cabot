### Types of alerts

Cabot supports arbitrary alerting channels via its plugin architecture. Out of the box, it supports:

*   Email
*   Hipchat
*   Slack
*   SMS
*   Telephone

You can see others on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=cabot+alert&submit=search), including Pushover, Telegram, Pagerduty, Opsgenie and Slack.

Rather than focusing on channels, we classify alert types as follows:

*   `Notifications` - things that let you know what's going on but don't interrupt your work. This includes email and non-alerting Hipchat messages (i.e. ones that do not @reference anyone).
*   `Alerts` - more intrusive but not guaranteed to wake you up at 3 am. This includes SMS and alerting Hipchat messages.
*   `Telephone alerts` - the most intrusive. Use sparingly unless you want to be woken up at 3am because stage is reporting a spike in CPU utilization.

#### Telephone alerts only on `Critical` status

Because telephone alerts are so intrusive, Cabot will only send telephone alerts when all the following conditions are met:

*   Alerts are enabled for the service
*   The service status is `Critical` (at least one failing check has `Critical` importance)
*   Telephone alerts are enabled for the service
*   There is at least one user configured as **either** currently on duty (via [calendar sync](rota.html)) **or** as the fallback duty officer (set on the user's [user profile](users.html))

Telephone alerts ignore the `Users to notify` list associated with a Service and will only call the duty officer or fallback duty officer.

### Configuring alert channels

#### Global config

All alerting channels (except email, which can run locally) depend on external services so need to be configured appropriately - see [Configuration](configuration.html) for instructions on how to set up account keys.

#### Hipchat alerts

Hipchat alerts require the user's Hipchat alias be configured in their user profile. See [Users](users.html) for instructions for adding Hipchat aliases.

#### Telephone and SMS alerts

Telephone and SMS alerts need the users full mobile phone number entered in their user profile. See [Users](users.html) for instructions for adding Hipchat aliases.

Remember:

*   Enter your full telephone number including international dialing prefix
*   Remove any leading zeroes that are included when dialling locally
*   Remove initial `+`

### Alert content

Most alerts give information about which checks are failing:

Telephone alerts give minimal information because it's hard to parse detail about what is failing and why over the phone, especially from a robocall. We recommend that you always use telephone alerts in conjunction with another alerting channel (Hipchat or SMS).
