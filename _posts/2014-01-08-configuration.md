### Files to edit

All configuration takes place through environment variables managed by Foreman.

#### Production

Production configuration lives in `conf/production.env`. You should copy and customise the template file included as `conf/production.env.example`.

To change env variables on a running instance, modify `conf/production.env` locally and deploy your changes with `fab deploy -H ubuntu@your.server.hostname` (as in the [5th step of the quickstart guide](quickstart.html)).

#### Development

See `conf/development.env.example`.

###Â Settings available

In order to use all functionality the following settings must be configured in `conf/production.env`. If you use `fab deploy` it will automatically generate an upstart service config including these:

* `SES_PASS`
