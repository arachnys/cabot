### Files to edit

All configuration takes place through environment variables managed by Foreman.

#### Production

Production configuration lives in `conf/production.env`. You should copy and customise the template file included as `conf/production.env.example`. 

To change env variables on running instance, modify `conf/production.env` and deploy your changes with `fab deploy -H ubuntu@your.server.hostname` command (as is [5th step of quickstart](quickstart.html)).

#### Development

See `conf/development.env.example`.
